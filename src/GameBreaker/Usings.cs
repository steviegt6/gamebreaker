// Historically, BufferRegion was a wrapper around Memory<byte>. However, this
// was unnecessary as Memory<byte> effectively accomplishes what BufferRegion
// set out to do -- provide a way to pass slices of a buffer around while still
// receiving changes to the original buffer. As such, BufferRegion has been
// replaced with Memory<byte> and the using directive below is used to make
// the transition easier.
global using BufferRegion = System.Memory<byte>;
