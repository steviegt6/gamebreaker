# GameBreaker

> GameMaker reverse-engineering tooling, done right.

---

GameBreaker is a GameMaker reverse-engineering and modding toolchain written in C# for .NET 6.

Taking into consideration previous projects' (subjective) successes and failures, GameBreaker intends to create a powerful, efficient, fast toolchain that reverse-engineering and modding GameMaker games significantly easier.

Currently planned is a reliable deserialization and serialization system. If all goes well, decompilation- and compilation-related projects will undergo experimentation. A free (as in free speech and free beer) desktop runner exists in an idealistic future as well.

## Licensing

GameBreaker utilizes research and code by myself and others, see [COPYING.md](COPYING.md) for peoples' hard work and relevant software licenses.
