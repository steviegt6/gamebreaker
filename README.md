# GameBreaker

> GameMaker reverse-engineering tooling, done right.

---

GameBreaker is a set of .NET projects written in C#, targeting the reverse-engineering of GameMaker games.

GameBreaker utilizes research and code by myself, as well as the hard work of others, including:
- [krzys-h/UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool)
- [colinator27/DogScepter](https://github.com/colinator27/DogScepter)
- [PoroCYon](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon)
  - [pcy.ulyssis.be/undertale](https://pcy.ulyssis.be/undertale/) (mirror of Mirrawr's site)
  - [PoroCYon/Altar.NET](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/Altar.NET)
  - and several gists

Taking in considerations of what has been done well and poorly in the past, GameBreaker hopes to create a powerful toolchain that makes tools for reverse-engineering and modding significantly easier. The current goal is to craft a powerful, efficient, and accurate compiler and decompiler.
