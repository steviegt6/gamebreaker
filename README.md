# GameBreaker

> GameMaker reverse-engineering and modding tools.

GameBreaker is (or, rather, plans to be) a complete suite for
reverse-engineering and modifying GameMaker games compiled to bytecode for VM
runners.

Standing on the shoulders of giants[^1], GameBreaker is developed of the goal
with being *mostly* version-agnostic[^2] and game-agnostic[^3].

[colinator27/DogScepter](https://github.com/colinator27/DogScepter),
[Undertale reversing](https://pcy.ulyssis.be/undertale/)

[^2]: GameBreaker should support whatever versions UndertaleModTool and
DogScepter support, which, while not all versions, encompasses a vast majority.

[^3]: I develop GameBreaker mostly for HoloCure modding, but I am fully
interested in supporting all games for all platforms.
